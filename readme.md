# Beauty App

## Goal
I would like to make an application that can create personalized recommendations
 for make up products.
 - Using collaborative filtering, make a strong emphasis of negative reviews to
 help users avoid making bad purchasing decisions.
 - Create a question and answer application where users are able to ask specific
 questions on the make up products and get an answer from the comments.
 - Select make up products that matches your skin color using a color detection
  model using deep learning.
